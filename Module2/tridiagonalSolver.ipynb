This algorithm is used to solve the system of equation $Ax=b$ to obtain the unknow vector $x$ using Gauss elimination. In this algorithm $A$ is only available based on those 3 vectors because it is not preferred to stores all zero elements of the matrix. By totally disregarding the zero elements in the matrix (which constitute most of the element in tridiagonal systems) the algorithm can result in significant savings in terms of computations.
