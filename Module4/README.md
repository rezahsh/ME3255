Module 4 covers numerical differentiation and integration. It includes the following topics which are explained and exercised using the Jupyter Notebooks in this folder.
* Numerical differentiation
  * Finite-Differences
  * Higher order forward, backward and central finite-difference tables (on uniformly spaced points)
  * Python function diff
  * Python function gradient
 * Differentiation on nonuniformly-spaced points.
 * Partial derivatives
* Numerical integration
  * Newton-Cotes methods
    * Trapezoid rule
    * Composite trapezoid rule
      * Python function trap
      * Python function trapdata
      * Python function trapz
    * Simpson's 1/3 rule
      * Composite Simpson's 1/3 rule
